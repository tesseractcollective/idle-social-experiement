# Idle Social Experiment Game White Paper

Idle Social Experiment (ISE) is a Massively Multiplayer Idle RPG/Resource Management Game built on a completely distributed architecture. These types of games are extremely popular and lucrative. One such game, AFK Arena, is one of the top 10 grossing games in 2020 (https://drive.google.com/file/d/19E0bXya2wX-tkuOIn4IhbE9Z2Z2EPKwi/view). Other games on the top 10 list such as Roblox, Gardenscapes, Pokemon Go, and League of Legends have proven gameplay elements we want to draw from as well. We want to take the fun and popularity of these kinds of games and provide a completely new and unique experience that is only possible on a distributed platform. Instead of funnelling these insane amounts of profits to private companies, we want to provide a gaming platform and experience that opens up a wide range of possibilities in actual ownership and player interaction. 

What if we could find out which types of governments and economies work the best by using data driven methods and individual choice; What if the entire game world could evolve organically based on what is effective and what people choose? What if we could do this with real stakes (crypto currency), real privacy and ownership, while having fun at the same time? We are setting out to answer these questions and more. 

## Key Concepts:

### Everything is a DID (Distributed Identifier https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)

Users/players, player characters (avatars), non-player characters, social groups/communities, organizations, governments, and more are all DIDs. This means they all exist in a decentralized system, maintain ownership and accountability, and can interact with other platforms and DIDs at large. Possible interactions include:
- Integration with DID-based social networks
- Ability to exchange in-game currencies to other currencies (including real-world and crypto currencies)
- User created content can become part of the game; Not only game mods but also blogs, video streaming, news, discussion boards, and other social content. 

### DID-based Governments Define Game Interactions
Governments provide the social and economic agreements that govern the game world. Each government has a charter that defines these agreements. Out of necessity, the games starts with a root government. Users (and any DID for that matter) must belong to a government but can choose to leave or join any government if the charter allows it. 

#### Root Government Charter
- Dictatorship owned and governed by Tesseract Collective
- Un-regulated capitalist economy
- Owns 10% of all assets (DIDs) inside the government
- Allows creation of sub-governments with their own charters
- Allows sub-governments to leave and become completely autonomous once they reach either 1 Million users or 50% of the number of users in the Root Government, whichever happens to be larger
- This charter can change at any time as determined by Tesseract Collective and a group of independant advisors (TBD).

Due to the nature of the root government charter, other governments can eventually separate from the root government and no longer be owned by the game's creator. This model incentivizes governements to do what is in the best interest of them and the DIDs (people and things) that they govern. We would like to see a wide variety of governing and economic systems in use with the ability of people to choose the systems that they want and that they feel will be the most advantagous to them. We also want to see governments and communities built up around arbitrary interests and ideas instead of just by geography, nationality, culture and race. 

### Gameplay

Each user is a DID that can associate itself with other DIDs and can own any number of DIDs. Initial DID types:
- Heroes (e.g. an NPC with specific stats typical to RPGs)
- Producers (e.g. a farm that produces food)
- Quests
- Campaigns
- Arenas with fights and leaderboards
